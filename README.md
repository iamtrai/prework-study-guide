# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a boot camp student, I wanted to leaern the basics of programming languages as well as Git and Github. As part of the pre course work, I created this webpage as a study guide to reference so that I can easily find and read the information and notes I collected as well as practice my coding and familiarize myself with Gitflow.
